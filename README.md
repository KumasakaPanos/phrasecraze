## Introduction:
PhaseCraze is a word game that is derived from the popular word game "Mad-Libs". The game uses a TCP and an HTTP server in order to work. Players join a socket and declare an admin. The admin is in charge of writing the script with the keywords that will be replaced by words from the players. Once the script is written, the keywords are distributed to all the players and they will insert their own words that they would like to see in the story. Once every player has submitted their words, the admin will enter the @submitall command and the script is reconstructed with the players words substituted in for the generic keywords that were put in by the admin.  
    - Thank you for playing!
## Getting Started:
Playing a game with your friends is easy!
1. For Mac and Linux users, type ```nc phrasecraze.website 3000```
  - If the nc command does not work, Install Net Cat.  
- For Windows users, open PUTTY and inpt "phrasecraze.website" into the "Host Name" input field, and 3000 in the "Port" input field. Also make sure "Connection Type" is set to TELNET.
2. You will then be put into the socket and you are now able to play a game and chat with other players!
3. To begin the game sequence, an admin must be declared. To declare yourself as the admin, just simply type "@admin".
4. When you are the admin, you can write a script and use brackets to declare the words you want substituted, for example: "[Boy_Name] and [Girl_Name] went up the hill to fetch a(n) [object]". You can also pull a script from the database using @pull [title]. To see titles in the database, use @titlelist.
5. After the script is written or pulled, the program will deconstruct it and send keywords to players.
6. If you are a player, you type "@submit" and then the words you want to hear in the story separated by spaces.
7. After every player has submitted their words, the admin uses the "@submitall" command. This command reconstructs the script with user generated words in place of the generic keywords.
8. Read your story!
